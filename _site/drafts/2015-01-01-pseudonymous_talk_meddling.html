    <h2>On pseudonymous talk meddling</h2>

    <p>Robin Hanson: <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/12/when-is-talk-meddling-okay.html">on talk meddling</a></p>

<p>claims that free speech/free hearing is generally good since it helps people be more informed, blah blah blah</p>
<ul>
  <li>hard to enforce norms against selectivity</li>
  <li>only good argument against is if retaliation might go beyond talk</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course the US has for many decades been quite involved in the internal affairs of many nations, including via assassination, funding rebel armies, bribery, academic and media lecturing, and selective information revelation. Some say Putin focused on embarrassing Clinton in retaliation for her previously supporting the anti-Putin side in Russian internal affairs. Thus it is hard to believe we really risk more US-Russian war if these two nations overtly talk about the others’ internal affairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh really? seems like nations are tense, people are moving, etc. even if war unlikely, still bad to increase prob</p>

<p>contrast: john howard saying that obama win <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pm-not-sorry-for-obama-attack/2007/02/12/1171128852742.html">good for taliban</a>. response was just talk, nobody really cared (john howard not mentioned in wikipedia articles).</p>

<p>difference: john howard had no hacking (but espionage seems like an acceptable thing for states to do). other difference: john howard had source clear. people could judge who said it and act accordingly. alleged russian hacking anonymous. means that more easily able to meddle.</p>

<p>means that people get less info to update on, potentially less informed. also relatively easy norm to enforce.</p>

<p>costs: value freedom individuals have to say things anonymously, means that they can give opinions without repercussions, and/or people will listen to unpopulars.</p>

<p>most people think anonymity is ok in some contexts. maybe bad thing is pseudonymity – presenting yourself as being in some different reference class (e.g. pretending to be random hackers when you’re a state, pretending to be poor when you’re rich). but what’s the relevant notion of reference class? or the relevant notion of pretending?</p>
