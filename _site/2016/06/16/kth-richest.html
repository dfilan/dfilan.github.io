    <h2>A data structure for range kth-smallest queries</h2>
    <p>Suppose I want to maintain a set of people where each has an age and a wealth. I want to be able to quickly insert people, delete people, and answer queries of the form “find the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th richest person whose age is between <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script>”.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of solutions to different variants on this question:</p>

<p>I have been somewhat interested in this question for about a year, and I’ve asked about related questions <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bshlgrs/posts/10205556609689335">a few</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31153033/data-structure-to-support-a-particular-query-on-a-set-of-2d-points">times</a>. But no-one’s ever managed to give me a complete answer.</p>

<p>The other day, I ran across <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/26299986/1360429">this StackOverflow answer</a>, which presents an answer which I modified to make a full solution, which I’ll present here.</p>

<p>My solution allows insertion and deletion in <script type="math/tex">O(\log^2(n))</script>, and allows the query in <script type="math/tex">O(\log^3(n))</script>.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Store an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic_tree">order statistic tree</a> ordered on age. At every node, store a pointer to an auxiliary order statistic tree, of all of that node’s descendants ordered on income.</p>

<p>At every node, this requires an extra amount of memory which is linear in the number of descendants of that node. So this means that the tree will take <script type="math/tex">O(n\cdot \log(n))</script> memory overall.</p>

<h3 id="query">Query</h3>

<p>You might want to go read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/26299986/1360429">that second StackOverflow answer</a> again, because this algorithm is similar to that one, and it’s easier to understand the algorithm on arrays.</p>

<p>The query is similar to how queries across ranges of an augmented BST usually work: we start out by finding the set of nodes whose descendants contain the whole subsection of the tree that you care about. There will be <script type="math/tex">\log(n)</script> of these nodes, and finding all of them takes <script type="math/tex">\log(n)</script> time.</p>

<p>We end up with <script type="math/tex">\log(n)</script> OSTs of maximum size <script type="math/tex">O(n)</script>, and we want to find the <script type="math/tex">k</script>th smallest item in their disjoint union.</p>

<p>As discussed <a href="/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html">here</a>, we can solve that query in <script type="math/tex">O\left(\log(n)^3\right)</script>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if your <script type="math/tex">k</script> is small, you can directly traverse the trees to find the correct answer, which takes <script type="math/tex">k \log(n) + n</script> time.</p>

<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>

<p>When I insert a new value into my set, I need to update the auxiliary OSTs of all of the ancestor nodes of my new node.</p>

<p>Usually, it’s easy to argue that maintaining auxiliary data in your OST is fast, because usually your auxiliary data is something like “the sum of your descendants” or something which is <script type="math/tex">O(1)</script>. In this data structure, the efficiency argument is somewhat more complicated.</p>

<p>Inserting a single item into an OST takes <script type="math/tex">O(\log(n))</script> time. But making the OST from scratch takes <script type="math/tex">O(n)</script>. This is concerning because it means that tree rotations are potentially extremely expensive. If I had to do tree rotations all the way up from my new node to the root of the tree every single insertion, then insertion would take linear time.</p>

<p>Luckily, we can decide that our OST is balanced using the red-black tree rules. Insertion in a red-black tree only involves amortized <script type="math/tex">O(1)</script> rotations. (See <a href="web.stanford.edu/class/cs166/lectures/05/Small05.pdf">here</a> for an explanation of this.)</p>

<p>The node at the lowest level will have to totally regenerate its auxiliary OST every insertion, of course. Its parent will have to do a tree rotation which requires it to totally regenerate its auxiliary OST every second insertion. Its grandparent will need to do that <script type="math/tex">\frac14</script> of the time. And then <script type="math/tex">\frac18</script> and so on.</p>

<p>At height <script type="math/tex">h</script> in the tree, defining the leaves to be <script type="math/tex">h=0</script>, the amortized cost of insertion is going to be <script type="math/tex">O(\log(2^h)) = O(h)</script> for insertion plus <script type="math/tex">O\left(\frac{2^h}{2^h}\right) = O(1)</script> for totally recreating the OST after a rebalance, for a total cost of <script type="math/tex">O(h)</script>.</p>

<p>The total time required for updating all the auxiliary OSTs after an insert is therefore:</p>

<p>$^$O\left(\sum_{h=0}^{log(n)} h \right)= O\left(\log(n)^2\right)$^$</p>

<p>Updating or deleting a node also takes <script type="math/tex">O\left(\log(n)^2\right)</script>, for the same reason.</p>

<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>

<h3 id="limited--k">limited <script type="math/tex">k</script></h3>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">k</script> is always going to fixed below a particular limit <script type="math/tex">l</script>–say, you know ahead of time that you’re never going to need to know farther back than the 50th richest person between two ages–each node in your main OST can store a smaller auxiliary tree with only <script type="math/tex">l</script> elements in it.</p>

<p>This reduces memory requirements to <script type="math/tex">O(n \cdot l)</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Queries</strong>: Using the algorithm for OSTs in <a href="/2016/06/16/generalized-multi-quickselect.html#table1">this table</a>, the cost is now <script type="math/tex">\log(\log(n) \cdot l) \cdot \log(n) \cdot \log(l)</script>, which looks like <script type="math/tex">\log(\log(n)) \cdot \log(n) \cdot \log(l)</script> as <script type="math/tex">n</script> grows.</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong>: Every ancestor needs to do <script type="math/tex">\log(l)</script> work now, instead of <script type="math/tex">\log(n)</script>, but you still have <script type="math/tex">\log(n)</script> ancestors. So update takes overall <script type="math/tex">\log(n)\log(l)</script> time.</p>
