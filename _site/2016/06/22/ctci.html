    <h2>Studying for startup interviews with 'Cracking the Coding Interview'</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> is by far the most popular interview prep book for software engineers. It’s a great book. But it was written for a few years ago, and software engineering interviews seem to have changed in the meantime, at least in the Silicon Valley engineering culture which I’m most involved in.</p>

<p>So I’ve written this guide to the book. It contains notes on things which I think have changed since it was written, and a list of the questions from the book which I think are most relevant to people preparing for software engineering interviews at good companies in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>I was inspired to write this by <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">InterviewCake</a>, which is a competitor to Cracking the Coding Interview. But InterviewCake is much more expensive than CtCI. I think this list of CtCI questions is about as good a list of interview questions as InterviewCake. There, I just saved you $180.</p>

<p>How have things changed? Most obviously, people use more scripting languages here and less C++ and Java. This has some direct effects. For example, there aren’t as many questions about merging arrays given buffer space anymore: that question still makes sense in scripting languages, but it doesn’t come up as much as it does in C. And I think Silicon Valley dislikes what it sees as verbose enterprise trivia bullshit, and purposefully doesn’t talk about such things. I think this is why I don’t hear about people being asked about design patterns.</p>

<p>The 5th edition is somewhat better than the 4th edition, because it has more content at the start of every chapter. I have not seen the 6th edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-most-relevant-questions">The most relevant questions</h2>

<p>Here is a subset of the questions which I think reflects SF software interviews more accurately:</p>

<p>Questions in the 4th edition:</p>

<p>1.1, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.8, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 9.2, 9.3, 9.6, 12.1, 12.2, 12.6, 12.7, 15.3, 17.5, 18.1, 18.2, 19.2, 19.7, 19.11, 20.10, 20.11.</p>

<p>Questions in the 5th edition:</p>

<p>1.1, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 8.1, 8.2, 8.5, 8.7, 8.9, 8.10, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 10.1, 10.2, 10.5, 10.6, 11.3, 11.6, 11.8, 15.5, 16.1, 17.2, 17.8, 17.12, 18.10, 18.11.</p>

<p>(Making those two lists felt like maintaining a codebase to work in both Python 2 and 3)</p>

<p>I would recommend giving these questions higher priority in your study.</p>

<p>Many of the questions that I didn’t include there are still good practice. If you want more practise on a particular topic, you should definitely do even the questions I didn’t include.</p>

<h2 id="general-notes">General notes</h2>

<p>Every chapter in the interview questions section of CtCI starts with a short summary of the subject matter for the questions. I think these notes are quite good. It’s well worth reading the notes for chapters even if you don’t do questions from them.</p>

<p>The first 40-ish pages of the book are general advice about software engineering interviews. I agree with all of it except the following points, organized by section:</p>

<p><strong>Before the interview</strong>: Companies don’t ask behavioral questions much.</p>

<p><strong>What You Need To Know (page 26)</strong>: Tries are not absolutely must-have knowledge. I’ve never heard of people being asked to implement quicksort in place. Singleton and Factory design patterns are not crucial knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>At the Interview</strong>: You don’t have to use C, C++, or Java. People will possibly be biased against you if you do. Ruby, Python, and Javascript are fine choices. I think it’s fine to do the problem in whatever language you want. You can ask your recruiter about this before the interview.</p>

<h2 id="comments-on-individual-question-chapters-in-the-4th-edition">Comments on individual question chapters (in the 4th edition):</h2>

<h3 id="chapter-1-arrays-and-strings">Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings</h3>

<p>Companies care less about seeing you edit data in place than they used to. I’d only expect questions on this if you’re applying for a C job. For this reason, questions [1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7] are lower priority.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-2-linked-lists">Chapter 2: Linked Lists</h3>

<p>All of these questions are less common these days because linked lists come up less, because we don’t use C as much and have more support for generics, leading to us coding our own data structures less often.</p>

<p><a href="http://shlegeris.com/2016/04/22/dumbest-algorithm-problem.html">Fuck question 2.2.</a></p>

<p>2.5 is a common bullshit brainteaser question.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-3-queues-and-stacks">Chapter 3: Queues and stacks</h3>

<p>I agree that you’ll look good if you can flawlessly implement a queue and stack.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-4-graphs-and-trees">Chapter 4: Graphs and trees</h3>

<p>Study BFS: it’s a really common question. These questions all seem reasonable.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-5-bit-manipulation">Chapter 5: Bit manipulation</h3>

<p>I’ve rarely seen these problems come up, even when I interviewed for a C++ systems job.</p>

<p>I include one question of this type in my list above.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-6-brainteasers">Chapter 6: Brainteasers</h3>

<p>These questions are widely reviled, and seem to be getting less common. Maybe memorize the answers in case you run across a bad interviewer.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-7-oop">Chapter 7: OOP</h3>

<p>These questions are good. The provided answers are idiomatic Java; if you’re answering in Python you should model your answers after idiomatic Python rather than the answers given.</p>

<p>I don’t hear about people being asked abstract questions like 7.3.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-8-recursion">Chapter 8: Recursion</h3>

<p>Many of these questions are classics which I’ve been asked many times before.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-9-searching-and-sorting">Chapter 9: Searching and sorting</h3>

<p>I think that it’s somewhat less common to be asked to write sorting algorithms these days.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-10-math">Chapter 10: Math</h3>

<p>I don’t hear about math questions being asked, except at extremely math heavy companies to applicants with a hardcore math background.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-11-testing">Chapter 11: Testing</h3>

<p>I don’t hear about these questions very much. I’ve never heard questions like “how would you test a pen”.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-12-system-design-and-memory-limits">Chapter 12: System design and memory limits</h3>

<p>I don’t hear about memory limit questions very often.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-13-and-14-c-and-java">Chapter 13 and 14: C++ and Java</h3>

<p>Only relevant if you’re interviewing in C++ or Java, and even then I’d be slightly surprised to get these questions–they seem somewhat like trivia to me. That said, I’ve been asked one of these questions before.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-15-databases">Chapter 15: Databases</h3>

<p>The advice given is somewhat out of date. I don’t think that I’ve ever heard about someone being asked to denormalize their SQL database schema for speed in an interview.</p>

<p>I think the “design a database to hold certain data” type questions are more common now. The rise of ORMs has led to SQL being somewhat less important for most developers.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-16-low-level">Chapter 16: Low level</h3>

<p>These questions are great, but I wouldn’t expect them at most generalist job interviews.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-17-networking">Chapter 17: Networking</h3>

<p>This is somewhat more low level than I think most people get asked. It’s worth knowing the answer to the famous “what happens after you type a URL into a browser” question though.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-18-threads-and-locks">Chapter 18: Threads and Locks</h3>

<p>Companies don’t seem to ask about concurrency primitives without warning you beforehand. Some of these questions are Java-specific.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-19-and-20-moderate-and-hard">Chapter 19 and 20: Moderate and Hard</h3>

<p>All these questions are popular questions. I don’t particularly like them.</p>
