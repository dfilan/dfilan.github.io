    <p class="post-meta"><time datetime="1969-12-31T16:00:00-08:00" itemprop="datePublished"></time></p>
    <p>A catalogue of public bets that I’ve made with individual people about stuff (not including bets made on prediction markets).</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the 16th of January 2017, I bet $50 of my money against $100 of Topher Brennan’s that Donald Trump would win the 2020 US Presidential election. Winner: unknown.</li>
  <li>On the 20th of October 2016, I bet $25 of my money against $5 of Max Kemeny’s that <a href="http://www.270towin.com/maps/3n2dY">this map</a>, showing Clinton winning all swing states including AZ but not GA or UT and Trump winning the rest, would not be the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. Winner: me.</li>
  <li>On the 8th of August 2016, I <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/08/johnson_bet.html">bet</a> $100 of my money against $100 of Bryan Caplan’s that Gary Johnson would receive greater than 5% of the popular vote in the 2016 US presidential election. Winner: Bryan Caplan.</li>
  <li>On the 24th of June 2016, I bet $200 of my money against $50 of Scott Fowler’s that Donald Trump would not lead Hillary Clinton by more than 6 percentage points in the popular vote in the 2016 US presidential election. Winner: me.</li>
  <li>On the 14th of March 2016 (after the fourth game AlphaGo played against Lee Sedol), I bet $50 of my money against $50 of Kevin Le’s that AlphaGo would win its final game against Lee Sedol. Winner: me.</li>
  <li>On the 9th of March 2016 (after the first game AlphaGo played against Lee Sedol), I bet $100 of my money against $150 of Andrew Kirk’s that AlphaGo would win all games in its match against Lee Sedol. Winner: Andrew Kirk.</li>
  <li>On the 9th of February 2016, I bet $100 of my money against $67 of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s that AlphaGo would win its match against Lee Sedol. Winner: me.</li>
</ul>
