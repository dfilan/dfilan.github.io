title:  "Review of 'Deep Work'"

# Outline of post
* Thesis of book: deep work is a useful and undervalued way of doing 'knowledge work'
* Book's advice:
    * Take time to work deeply
    * Enjoy real downtime
    * Practice spending periods of time being free of distraction
* Seems sketchy
    * Support for deep work seems like it consists of unpersuasive anecdotes, semi-bullshit science
    * That being said, parts of it seem intuitively compelling
    * I'd say it's worth a shot???
* hmmmm maybe I should wait until I actually implement scheduling/deep-working to write this...
