title:  "Consider not donating under $100 to political candidates"

Epistemic status: thing people have told me that seems right. Also primarily relevant to US audiences. Also I am speaking in my personal capacity and not representing any employer, present or past.

Sometimes, I talk to people who work in the AI governance space. One thing that multiple people have told me, which I found surprising, is that there is apparently a real problem where people accidentally rule themselves out of AI policy positions by making political donations of small amounts---in particular, under $10.

My understanding is that in the United States, donations to political candidates are a matter of public record, and that if you donate to candidates of one party, this might look bad if you want to gain a government position when another party is in charge. Therefore, donating approximately $3 can significantly damage your career, while not helping your preferred candidate all that much. Furthermore, at the time you make this donation, you might not realize that you will later want to get a government position.

Now, I don't want to overly discourage this sort of thing. It's your money, free speech is great, and fundamentally I think it's fine to have and publicly express political views (for example, I think Donald Trump is extremely bad, and am disappointed in my fellow countrymen for voting for him). That said, I think that one should be aware of the consequences of making political donations, and it seems plausible to me that if you're not willing to donate more than $100 to a political candidate, consider that the career cost to you of making that donation may be higher than the benefit that it confers.
