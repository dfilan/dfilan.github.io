You claim P? OK. But even if you're right about P...

- ... if I assume P, then I can prove not P. So, by contradiction, P is false. So you're wrong.
- ... if you really believed P, then you would have [a certain appropriate mood](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html). But it doesn't seem like you have that mood. So you're wrong.
- ... with 99% probability, as long as there's a 1% chance that P is wrong, according to expected value, we should act like P is wrong. So you're wrong.
- ... accepting P would mean that you should do this weird action A. But you don't do A, as far as I can tell. So you're wrong.
- ... yesterday, you said Q, and Q implies not P. So you were wrong yesterday or today. So you're wrong.
- ... somebody might infer Q from P. But Q is false! So you're wrong.
- ... someone might infer from your expression of P that you believe Q. But Q is false! So you're wrong.
