Robin Hanson: [on talk meddling](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/12/when-is-talk-meddling-okay.html)

claims that free speech/free hearing is generally good since it helps people be more informed, blah blah blah
* hard to enforce norms against selectivity
* only good argument against is if retaliation might go beyond talk

Of course the US has for many decades been quite involved in the internal affairs of many nations, including via assassination, funding rebel armies, bribery, academic and media lecturing, and selective information revelation. Some say Putin focused on embarrassing Clinton in retaliation for her previously supporting the anti-Putin side in Russian internal affairs. Thus it is hard to believe we really risk more US-Russian war if these two nations overtly talk about the othersâ€™ internal affairs.
