Recently, Catholic apologist Joe Heschmeyer has produced [a couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_SGbUDFQWg) [of videos](url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlSkKi3chQA) arguing against the Protestant view of the Bible - specifically, the claims of Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity (capitalized because I'll want to refer to them as premises later). "Sola Scriptura" has been operationalized a few different ways, but one way that most Protestants would agree on is (taken from the Westminster confession):
> The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for [...] manâ€™s salvation [...] is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture

"Perspicuity" means clarity, and is propounded in the Westminster confession like this:
> [T]hose things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.

So, in other words, Protestants think that everything you need to know to be saved is in the Bible, and is expressed so obviously that anyone who reads it and thinks about it in a reasonable way will understand it.

I take Heschmeyer's argument to be that if Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity were true, then all reasonable people who have read the Bible and believe it would agree on which doctrines were necessary for salvation - in other words, you wouldn't have a situation where one person thinks P and P is necessary for salvation, while another thinks not-P, or a third thinks that P is not necessary for salvation. But in fact this situation happens a lot, even among seemingly sincere followers of the Bible who believe in Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity. Therefore Sola Scriptura and Perspecuity are false. (For the rest of this post, I'll write Nec(P) for the claim "P is necessary for salvation" to save space.)

I think this argument doesn't quite work. Here's why:

It can be the case that the Bible clearly explains everything that you need to believe, but it doesn't clearly explain which things you need to believe. In other words, Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity say that for all P such that Nec(P), the Bible teaches P clearly - but they don't say that for such P, the Bible teaches P clearly, and also clearly teaches Nec(P). Nor do they say that the only things that are taught clearly in the Bible are things you need to believe (otherwise you could figure out which doctrines you had to believe by just noticing what things the Bible clearly teaches).

For example, suppose that the Bible clearly teaches that Jesus died for at least some people, and that followers of Jesus should get baptized, and in fact, the only thing you need to believe to be saved is that Jesus died for at least some people. In that world, people of good faith could disagree about whether you need to believe that Jesus died for at least some people, and this would be totally consistent with Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity.

Furthermore, suppose that it's not clear to people of good faith whether or not something is clear to people of good faith. Perhaps something could seem clear to you but not be clear to others of good faith, or also something could be clear but others could fail to understand it because they're not actually of good faith (you need this part otherwise you can tell if something's clear by noticing if anyone disagrees with you). Then, you can have one person who believes P and Nec(P), and another who believes not-P and Nec(not-P), and that be consistent with Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity.

For example, take the example above, and suppose that some people read the Bible as clearly saying that Jesus died for everyone (aka Unlimited Atonement), and others read the Bible as clearly saying that Jesus only died for his followers (aka Limited Atonement). You could have that disagreement, and if the two groups think the others are being disingenuous, they could both think that you have to agree with them to be saved, while still having Sola Scriptura and Perspicuity being true.

That said, Heschmeyer's argument is still going to limit the kinds of Protestantism you can adopt. In the above example, if we suppose that you can tell that neither group is in fact being disingenuous, then his argument rules out the combination of Sola Scriptura, Perspicuity, and Limited Atonement (as well as Sola Scriptura, Perspicuity, and Unlimited Atonement). In this way, applied to the real world, it's going to rule out versions of Protestantism that claim that you have to believe a bunch of things that sincere Christians who are knowledgeable about the Bible don't agree on. That said, it won't rule out Protestantisms that are liberal about what you can believe while being saved.
