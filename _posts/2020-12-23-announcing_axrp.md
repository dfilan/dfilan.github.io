Happy holidays! Today, I'm launching AXRP (pronounced axe-urp), the AI X-risk Research Podcast. The episodes involve me interviewing a researcher about a paper they've written, talking about the ideas in the paper and why they matter. The first three guests are [Adam Gleave](https://www.gleave.me/), [Rohin Shah](https://rohinshah.com/), and [Andrew Critch](http://acritch.com/). You can listen on all major podcast distribution networks by searching "AXRP", or read transcripts online at [axrp.net](https://axrp.net/). If you have comments about the show, feel free to leave them here, or to email me at <feedback@axrp.net>.
