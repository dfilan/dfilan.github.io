I have a friend who is generally a fan of mathematical structures and the relationships between them. For Christmas, he asked me to make a diagram of certain sets of mathematical objects and the relationships between them. One instance of this would have been a [diagram](https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/File:Really-important-inclusions.png) of [complexity classes](https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo), with an arrow from class C to class D if every problem in class C was also in class D. Another instance would be a diagram of types of algebraic objects ([groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)), [rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)), etc.). Instead, I chose to diagram types of topological spaces - plotting various separation axioms, countability axioms, compactness properties, connectivity properties, and metrisability properties.
