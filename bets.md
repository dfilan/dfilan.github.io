A catalogue of public bets that I've made with individual people about stuff (not including bets made on prediction markets).

* On the 2nd of March 2022, I bet $100 of my money against $2,000 of Nu√±o Sempere's that NATO will get involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict by the end of 2022, perhaps by NATO troops being killed by Russia in Ukraine. It is a "gentleman's agreement" where we will attempt to come to consensus between ourselves on the resolution in good faith. In the event of no agreement, we will each donate $100 to charity. Winner: unknown.
* On the 21st of February 2022, I bet $100 of my money against $100 of Elizabeth Garrett's that there will be no "obesity vaccine" by the 21st of February 2042. An "obesity vaccine" is a vaccine (that is, something you'd call a vaccine, designed to prepare your immune system to defeat a pathogen, a nasal vaccine would count) that is designed and marketed to have the result of reducing the probability that the vaccinated person becomes obese by at least 3%. Ray Arnold will arbitrate in the case of a dispute. Winner: unknown.
* On the 4th of November 2019, I bet $20 of my money against $20 of Duncan Sabien's that the following will not happen: In the 2020 US Presidential election, either a majority of votes in the electoral college are cast for Donald Trump, or no candidate recieves a majority of votes in the electoral college, and the US House of Representatives subsequently votes for Donald Trump to be the US President. Winner: me.
* On the 20th of April 2019, I bet $10 of my money against $90 of Robert Wiblin's that Pete Buttigieg would be the Democratic nominee for the US presidency in 2020. Winner: Robert Wiblin.
* On the 9th of September 2018, I bet $0.10 of my money against $10 of Duncan Sabien's that there would be at least 3 separate incidents of US senators physically fighting other US senators in US senate buildings by the 1st of October 2023. Winner: unknown.
* On the 16th of January 2017, I bet $50 of my money against $100 of Topher Brennan's that Donald Trump would win the 2020 US Presidential election. Winner: Topher Brennan.
