A catalogue of public bets that I've made with individual people about stuff (not including bets made on prediction markets). This is intended to be exhaustive but is probably not: please email me with omissions or inaccuracies.

* On the 20th of October 2016, I bet $25 of my money against $5 of Max Kemeny's that [this map](http://www.270towin.com/maps/3n2dY), showing Clinton winning all swing states including AZ but not GA or UT and Trump winning the rest, would not be the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. Winner: unknown.
* On the 8th of August 2016, I [bet](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/08/johnson_bet.html) $100 of my money against $100 of Bryan Caplan's that Gary Johnson would receive greater than 5% of the popular vote in the 2016 US presidential election. Winner: unknown.
* On the 24th of June 2016, I bet $200 of my money against $50 of Scott Fowler's that Donald Trump would not lead Hillary Clinton by more than 6 percentage points in the popular vote in the 2016 US presidential election. Winner: unknown.
* On the 14th of March 2016 (after the fourth game), I bet $50 of my money against $50 of Kevin Le's that AlphaGo would win its final game against Lee Sedol. Winner: me.
* On the 9th of March 2016 (after the first game), I bet $100 of my money against $150 of Andrew Kirk's that AlphaGo would win all games in its match against Lee Sedol. Winner: Andrew Kirk.
* On the 9th of February 2016, I bet $100 of my money against $67 of Eliezer Yudkowsky's that AlphaGo would win its match against Lee Sedol. Winner: me.
