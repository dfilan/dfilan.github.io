A catalogue of public bets that I've made with individual people about stuff (not including bets made on prediction markets).

* On the 13th of June 2024, I bet $100 of my money against $350 of Eric Neyman's that Trump will win the state of Virginia in the 2024 US Presidential election. If Joe Biden is not the Democratic candidate, or Donald Trump is not the Republican candidate, the bet is voided. Winner: unknown.
* On the 9th of June 2024, I bet $400 of my money against $100 of Tom Shlomi's that no plausible contender for the best publicly available language model will be made by Google, as judged by Isabel Juniewicz on the 9th of June 2025. Winner: unknown.
* On the 22nd of January 2024, I bet $300 of my money against $100 of Isaac King's that Peter Miller would win his debate with Rootclaim on the origins of COVID, as determined by judge votes. If the judges are undecided, the bet is cancelled. Winner: me.
* On the 28th of July 2023, I bet $100 of my money against $100 of Shreyas Kapur's that Narendra Modi will be elected Prime Minister in the 2024 Indian general election. If a BJP member other than Modi is elected Prime Minister, or any other person is elected Prime Minister, then Shreyas wins. If no election occurs, or no PM is voted on, the bet is void. Winner: me.
* On the 2nd of March 2022, I bet $100 of my money against $2,000 of Nuño Sempere's that NATO will get involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict by the end of 2022, perhaps by NATO troops being killed by Russia in Ukraine. It is a "gentleman's agreement" where we will attempt to come to consensus between ourselves on the resolution in good faith. In the event of no agreement, we will each donate $100 to charity. Winner: Nuño Sempere.
* On the 21st of February 2022, I bet $100 of my money against $100 of Elizabeth Garrett's that there will be no "obesity vaccine" by the 21st of February 2042. An "obesity vaccine" is a vaccine (that is, something you'd call a vaccine, designed to prepare your immune system to defeat a pathogen, a nasal vaccine would count) that is designed and marketed to have the result of reducing the probability that the vaccinated person becomes obese by at least 3%. Ray Arnold will arbitrate in the case of a dispute. Winner: unknown.
* On the 4th of November 2019, I bet $20 of my money against $20 of Duncan Sabien's that the following will not happen: In the 2020 US Presidential election, either a majority of votes in the electoral college are cast for Donald Trump, or no candidate recieves a majority of votes in the electoral college, and the US House of Representatives subsequently votes for Donald Trump to be the US President. Winner: me.
* On the 20th of April 2019, I bet $10 of my money against $90 of Robert Wiblin's that Pete Buttigieg would be the Democratic nominee for the US presidency in 2020. Winner: Robert Wiblin.
